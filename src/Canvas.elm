{-| The canvas html element is a very simple way to render 2D graphics. Check out these examples, and get an explanation of the canvas element [here](https://github.com/elm-community/canvas). Furthermore, If you havent heard of [Elm-Graphics](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-graphics/latest), I recommend checking that out first, because its probably what you need. Elm-Canvas is for when you need unusually direct and low level access to the canvas element.

{-| A `Canvas` contains image data, and can be rendered as html with `toHtml`. There are many drawing functions in this package, and they all operate on `Canvas`. 
-}
type Canvas
  = Canvas

{-| Sometimes loading an `Image` from a url wont work. When it doesnt, youll get an `Error` instead.
-}
type Error 
  = Error

{-| A `Position` contains x and y coordinates. Many functions will take a `Position` to indicate where a drawing should occur on a `Canvas`. This type alias is identical to the one found in `elm-lang/mouse`.
-}
type alias Position = 
  { x : Int, y : Int }


{-| A `Size` contains a width and a height`, both of which are `Int`. Many functions will take a `Size` to indicate the size of a canvas region. This type alias is identical to the one found in `elm-lang/window`.
-}
type alias Size =
  { width : Int, height : Int }


type DrawOp
  = Fill
  | Rect Position Size
  | FillStyle String
  | BeginPath


{-| `initialize` takes in a width and a height (both type `Int`), and returns a `Canvas` with that width and height. A freshly initialized `Canvas` is entirely transparent (its data is an array of 0s, that has a length of width x height x 4)

    squareCanvas : Int -> Canvas
    squareCanvas length =
      initialize (Size length length)
-}
initialize : Size -> Canvas
initialize =
  Native.Canvas.initialize


{-|To turn a `Canvas` into `Html msg`, run it through `toHtml`. The first parameter of `toHtml` is a list of attributes just like node in `elm-lang/html`. 

    pixelatedRender : Canvas -> Html Msg
    pixelatedRender canvas =
      toHtml [ class "pixelated" ] canvas
-}
toHtml : List (Attribute msg) -> Canvas -> Html msg
toHtml =
  Native.Canvas.toHtml


batch : List DrawOp -> Canvas ->  Canvas
batch =
  Native.Canvas.batch

{-|Load up an `Image` from a url. 

    loadSteelix : Cmd Msg
    loadSteelix =
      Task.attempt ImageLoaded (loadImage "./steelix.png")

    update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
    update message model =
      case message of
        ImageLoaded -> result of
          case Result.toMaybe result of
            Just image ->
              -- ..
            Nothing ->
              -- ..
        -- ..
-}
loadImage : String -> Task Error Canvas
loadImage =
  Native.Canvas.loadImage


{-|`Canvas` have image data. Image data is an array of `Int`, all of which are between 0 and 255. They represent the RGBA values of every pixel in the image, where the first four `Int` are the color values of the first pixel, the next four `Int` the second pixels, etc.
